Frameworks and modules
-
Please list the frameworks and modules used in your program
and explain briefly why did you choose them.

### Web framework
express.js - it's lightweight and I am already accustomed to working with it. It helped me easily handle routing.
### Test framework
Jest - I like having a simple test setup and I recently met one of the core devs in Jest team.
### Other modules
node-fetch - because it has built-in body parser and uses promises out of the box.
