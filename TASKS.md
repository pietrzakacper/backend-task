Programming Tasks for Node - Tasks A.
See: [README](README.md).

Introduction
-
You will create a simple HTTP server in Node.js.
You can use any framework of your choice or no framework at all if you prefer.

You can use any module from npm that can help you with the tasks.
Please list the modules you used in [USER](USER.md)
and explain very briefly why do you think it's a good choice.

Please code in a style that is most readable and maintainable in your opinion.
You can use all new features of Node that work without transpilation
in Node v8.x, excluding those that require the `--harmony` flag.
The code doesn't have to work on any earlier version of Node.

Dependencies:

The `node_modules` directory should not be included in the repo.
All the dependencies should be installed with `npm install`.

Running the program:

The program should be started with `npm start` and should run in the foreground.
It must be terminated with Ctrl-C.

Requirements:

* Compatible with Node v8.x
* No need for `--harmony` flag
* No transpilation steps
* No external services
* No bundled dependencies

Tasks
-
Completing the tasks will result in a single application.
Every new task adds a simple functionality.

For every task you can use any framework or module
that you want or you can use no framework or module at all.
Please do what you think is the most reasonable choice.

Remember about the correct response codes and content types.

See the issues in this repo for specific tasks,
choose Sorting from Oldest and start from issue #1.

Good luck!
